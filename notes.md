#Notes:
######Profitability Algorithm:
**````((((x*y)*(z))*U)*YY = YY````**

- x = Unit cost
- y = **Core profit**
- z = **Perpetuity Agreement %**
- U = Units sold
- YY = Years

One of the easiest ways to make money as a site, would be to allow the exercise of options on a particular project.
For example:
Company A patents a product x. It's a licensable patent, and can be sold at the enterprise level, that enterprise buys 200 units. It costs Company A $6000 to develop, maintain, and market the unit. Company A sells the license to use the unit at $10000/unit.

Investor A has agreed to a perpetuity agreement with Company A for a 1% share of the profits of each unit sold.

Company A agrees to hold the perpetuity agreement for 5 years.

Investor A makes $40000 over a 5 year term. ((((10000*.4)*(.01))*200)*5
