#Idyuh

##Overview:
###Who are we?
**Oxtnet LLC.:** We are a research and development company based in Houston, TX.

Our mission is to provide innovative services and applications to the technology realm, and to develop ways to create what we have designated as the "Next, Next Net".

Our founders, Justin Jaehne, and Richard Kellermeyer, have been developing various business models for over 7 years, and have recently determined that it is best if we work in tandem to bring these new ideas to fruition.

Mr. Jaehne, pronounced "Yay-nee", is a native of the Houston area, CEO of OxtNet LLC., and has an extensive background in real estate and business structure.

Mr. Kellermeyer is a seasoned veteran of the software industry, and brings an extensive knowledge of architectural and application design patterns to OxtNet. Richard started developing iDyuh (pronounced "eye-d-yuh or idea") over 10 years ago, and upholds the cultural commitment to the project and development teams.

###What are we trying to accomplish?
Our plan for Idyuh is to facilitate the flow of patentable intellectual property (IP) to a tangible product. We plan to accomplish this by constructing a new way for innovators, investors, professional service providers, etc ... To collaborate in order to accomplish a set of goals.

Our application/engine will provide, not only a means for people to network and collaborate, but a secure environment for their IP to be housed until it is ready to enter the patent process, or better yet, we redefine how the patent process is structured.

iDyuh follows a close commitment to improve monolithic practices that have failed to protect IP for many decades. In the past, an owner of IP could choose to protect their property by paying ridiculous amounts of money to have them patented and documented by the USPTO. As history has proven, and modern technological improvements have advanced, our antiquated system of IP protection is no longer effective. It's time for the "Next" steps to be taken to ensure that those that dedicate time, money, blood, sweat, and tears to new ideas, maintain control of what is rightfully theirs.

###When are we expecting to launch?
iDyuh is expected to launch in late 2016. A MVP (Minimum Viable Product) is slated to be presented to investors by no later than May 31, 2016.

###Where is our target market?
Anyone who has an idea, whether that be a physical product, lyrics to the next Top 10 #1 hit, movie, software suite, mobile application, widget, thingamabob, or whatchacallit. We cater to anyone who wishes to take their idea from a simple thought to the next best seller in their realm.

###Why we need this application in the new information age?
The current system for protecting IP is far past broken. Those with money can easily crush their competition, and seize control of markets that they should not have rights to control.

The USPTO has been a broken system since it was founded. There are well known cases of inventors being harassed into divulging their IP going back farther than Edison bullying Tesla.

With modern encryption algorithms, distributed data storage, non-columnar data arrangements,  and top-notch authentication methods, there should be no reason that a person should need to pay exorbitant amounts of money to have their ideas protected and stored without fear that they will be compromised or distributed to onlookers without their prior consent.

###How we provide a Value Added Service
We give the inventors, investors, mentors and all other professionals a means to work together to produce higher quality products, all the while, providing tools that help to guide the project focus and protect the interests of all parties involved.
